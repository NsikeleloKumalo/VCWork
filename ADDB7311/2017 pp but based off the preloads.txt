Question 2: Create an SQL query that will display the customer who has made the least number of pet purchases.


-- Query to find the customer with the least number of pet purchases
SELECT customer_name AS CUSTOMER_NAME, COUNT(pet_id) AS PURCHASE_COUNT
FROM CUSTOMER
LEFT JOIN PET_SALES ON CUSTOMER.customer_id = PET_SALES.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_name
HAVING COUNT(pet_id) = (SELECT MIN(purchase_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(pet_id) AS purchase_count FROM PET_SALES GROUP BY customer_id))
ORDER BY CUSTOMER_NAME;

-- Sample Data
-- CUSTOMER_NAME      PURCHASE_COUNT
-- Sally Williams     1
-- Sam Henry          1
-- Jabulani Zintle    1
-- Jeff Jones         1
-- Jack West          1

Question 3: Create an SQL query to display the customer name and the total amount spent on pet purchases.


-- Query to calculate the total amount spent by each customer on pet purchases
SELECT customer_name AS CUSTOMER_NAME, SUM(price) AS TOTAL_AMOUNT_SPENT
FROM CUSTOMER
JOIN PET_SALES ON CUSTOMER.customer_id = PET_SALES.customer_id
JOIN PETS ON PET_SALES.pet_id = PETS.pet_id
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY CUSTOMER_NAME;

-- Sample Data
-- CUSTOMER_NAME      TOTAL_AMOUNT_SPENT
-- Jabulani Zintle    280.00
-- Jeff Jones         3800.00
-- Sam Henry          2500.00
-- Sally Williams     5000.00
-- Jack West          550.00

Question 4: Create a PL/SQL query to display the pet type and the date of purchase for the sale with ID 1.


-- PL/SQL Block to display pet type and sales date for sale with ID 1
DECLARE
  v_pet_type VARCHAR2(50);
  v_sales_date DATE;
BEGIN
  -- Retrieve pet type and sales date for sale with ID 1
  SELECT pet_type, sales_date
  INTO v_pet_type, v_sales_date
  FROM PETS
  JOIN PET_SALES ON PETS.pet_id = PET_SALES.pet_id
  WHERE PET_SALES.sales_id = 1;

  -- Display the results
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('PET TYPE: ' || v_pet_type);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SALES DATE: ' || TO_CHAR(v_sales_date, 'DD/MON/YY'));
END;
/

-- Sample Output
-- PET TYPE: Cat
-- SALES DATE: 17/MAR/23

Based of all 3 tables 

Sample Data for Question 2 (Customer with Least Pet Purchases):

Assuming the following data in the CUSTOMER and PET_SALES tables:

Table CUSTOMER:

CUSTOMER_ID | CUSTOMER_NAME    | CUSTOMER_EMAIL
----------------------------------------------
cust_101    | Jeff Jones       | jj@xcom.com
cust_102    | Sally Williams   | sally@ymail.com
cust_103    | Sam Henry        | sam@xsat.com
cust_104    | Jack West        | jw@xsat.com
cust_105    | Jabulani Zintle  | jaz@xsat.com
Table PET_SALES:


SALES_ID | SALES_DATE    | PET_ID | CUSTOMER_ID
----------------------------------------------
1        | '15-Mar-2023' | 100002 | cust_101
2        | '17-Mar-2023' | 100001 | cust_104
3        | '27-Mar-2023' | 100003 | cust_103
4        | '30-Mar-2023' | 100005 | cust_102
5        | '31-Mar-2023' | 100004 | cust_105
The query will output:


CUSTOMER_NAME   | PURCHASE_COUNT
-------------------------------
Sally Williams  | 1

Create an SQL query that will display the customer who has made the least number of pet purchases.

SELECT customer_name AS CUSTOMER_NAME, COUNT(*) AS PURCHASE_COUNT
FROM CUSTOMER c
LEFT JOIN PET_SALES ps ON c.customer_id = ps.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
    SELECT MIN(PURCHASE_COUNT)
    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS PURCHASE_COUNT
        FROM CUSTOMER c
        LEFT JOIN PET_SALES ps ON c.customer_id = ps.customer_id
        GROUP BY c.customer_name
    )
);

Sample Data for Question 3 (Total Spending by Customers):

Assuming the same data as above, the query will output:

SELECT c.customer_name AS CUSTOMER_NAME, SUM(p.price) AS TOTAL_SPENT
FROM CUSTOMER c
LEFT JOIN PET_SALES ps ON c.customer_id = ps.customer_id
LEFT JOIN PETS p ON ps.pet_id = p.pet_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name;

Sample Data for Question 4 (First Purchase Date for 'cust_101'):

Assuming the same data as above, the query will output:


CUSTOMER NAME: Jeff Jones
SALES DATE: 15/MAR/23

Create a PL/SQL query to display the customer name and the sales date for the first pet purchase made by customer ID 'cust_101'.

    INTO v_customer_name, v_sales_date
    FROM CUSTOMER c
    JOIN PET_SALES ps ON c.customer_id = ps.customer_id
    WHERE c.customer_id = 'cust_101'
    AND ROWNUM = 1
    ORDER BY ps.sales_date ASC;

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('CUSTOMER NAME: ' || v_customer_name);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SALES DATE: ' || TO_CHAR(v_sales_date, 'DD/MON/YY'));
