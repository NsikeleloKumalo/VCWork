--Data Defenition Laguages = any sql comand used to define some database objects like creating a view, table index etc. I am ading something new into the database. So if any sql comand is effecting the structure or info of the database = DDL  

--Data Manipulation Language = once you have created the table mow you need to modify them or insert data. When you insert or manipulate data it doesnt afect the structure of the database but it does afect the structure of the table for example when you adding, updating, modifing info things are gona change in the table. So if anything wil afect the data in a table then it is apart of DML 
 
-- Data Retrival Language =  Once we have data we wil retrieve it so like select statements

-- Data Control Language = Deals with accessability = restriction of view to the data / roles of the user wil be used
