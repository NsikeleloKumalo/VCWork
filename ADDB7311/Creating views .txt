create view EmpVu50 as select Employee_Id, First Name ||' ' || Last Name as EmpName, Email, Salary, Department_id from Employees where Department_id=50; 

to call View: 
select * from EmpVu50;

create or replace view EmpVu50 as select Employee_Id, First Name ||' ' || Last Name as EmpName, Email, Salary,Job_id, Department_id from Employees where Department_id=50; 

desc user_views;

select text from user_views where View_name = 'EMPVU50';

 delete from Empvu50 where Employee_id=185;

update Empvu50 set salary = 2800 where  Employee_id=199;

update Empvu50 set Department_Id = 60  where  Employee_id=199;

Cant do anything if there is an expression Alias:
update Empvu50 set EmpName = 'Anadi Sharma' where  Employee_id=199; --it wont work due to the virtual column 

cant do insertion or updating:
create or replace view EmpVu50 as select Employee_Id, First Name ||' ' || Last Name as EmpName, Email, Salary,Job_id, Department_id from Employees where Department_id=50
with check option; 

Read only view means you cant perform any dml operations: 
create or replace view EmpVu50 as select Employee_Id, First Name ||' ' || Last Name as EmpName, Email, Salary,Job_id, Department_id from Employees where Department_id=50
with read only;
